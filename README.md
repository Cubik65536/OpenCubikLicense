## Background

In the 21st century, the world is changing. Considering the increasing of copyright awareness, the need of having a better way to protect the rights of the authors and the users of the software and information is quick climbing.

To face this situation, the OpenCubik License Framework is developed.

## Structure

Usually, a project will have a license (e.g. MIT, Apache, GPL, etc. for software and CC-BY for articles). But the restriction of the license is not enough in some cases. So, that's how we make the structure, there's a general license (e.g. OCAL) for a certain type of project, and there's sub licenses for more precise cases (e. g. OCAL-NO-CSDN).

## Compatibility

There's some licenses who's compatible with other public licenses. For exemple, AOCSL is compatible with AGPLv3. Which means, even though you cannot use AOCSL for a fork of project under AGPL (according to AGPL), you can use AOCSL or AGPL as you want when you fork a project under AOCSL (according to AOCSL).

Details on compatible licenses for each license will be added to the top of the LICENSE file.

## Format

The every OpenCubik License text will be definitely available in these formats: plain text and Markdown. And some of the license will also be available in HTML, ODF, RTF, and LaTeX formats (we are working on providing as much formats as we could).

**These documents are not formatted for standalone publishing, and are intended to be included in another document.**
